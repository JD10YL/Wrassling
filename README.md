## Description

This is my attempt at recreating Brad Erkkila's Wrassling using C++ and the ge211 game engine. I used the Model-Controller-View pattern to create the game. I implemented the game physics from scratch and used the Seperating Axis Theorem to detect collisions. I tried to keep the physics as simple as possible to allow for some of the weird-fun randomness that can be found in Brad Erkkila's Wrassling.
